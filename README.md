# ARES-Compiler
A compiler/transpiler for the programming language ARES.


ARES is a language that aims to be excessively simple while still being crazy fast.
A hard mountain to climb, i know.

Or is it ?

The way ARES currently works is that it acts as an interface between the user and C++, which in theory could give the user a better experience coding while still be able to obtain an executable program with performances similar to native C++.

If you want to learn more about the language in itself please read the "ARES_language.md" file inside this repositery, as this present file will be dedicated to the compiler/transpiler itself.

## IMPORTANT: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAIN EXPECTED FEATURES MIGHT BE MISSING
